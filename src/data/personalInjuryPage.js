    content: `<strong>Should I contact a personal injury lawyer?</strong><br/>A personal injury lawyer should be used when you have suffered serious injury, illness, or permanent disability because of someone else’s negligence.

    content: `<strong>When should I hire a personal injury lawyer?</strong><br/>You should ideally hire a personal injury lawyer before speaking to any insurance companies. Because insurance companies want to limit payouts as much as possible, they may coerce you into admission of guilt or minimize your injury to avoid paying you large sums. Legal counsel will protect you to help ensure you’re payed the full amount that will ease the burden of your loss.<br/>You also want to begin evaluating your claim right away for the best evidence. Don’t rely on police reports to provide accurate or sufficient data. Police reports are often inadmissible in personal injury cases.`,
